# Text2Number-Utility: Intelligent Text-to-Number Processing

**A Python module for the intelligent conversion and calculation of textual numbers, designed for Natural Language Processing pipelines.**

The **Text2Number-Utility** is an efficient, standalone Python module engineered to intelligently convert numerical words (e.g., "two 3s") into computable numeric values. It serves as a crucial component for larger Machine Learning and NLP projects by bridging the gap between raw, unstructured text and structured numerical data. This utility allows developers and researchers to bypass the complexities of grammatical parsing, transforming a fundamental aspect of textual data into a machine-readable format.

## Core Features üåü

  * **Comprehensive Conversion:** Converts number words from "one" to "ten" into their integer equivalents.
  * **Accurate Arithmetic:** Supports multiplication of number words with adjacent digits, calculating and summing the final result.
  * **Zero External Dependencies:** This script operates entirely on its own, without loading any external libraries. This makes it exceptionally lightweight and easy to integrate into any project environment.
  * **Modular & Extensible Design:** The code is structured to allow for straightforward addition of new functionalities, such as support for a wider range of number words or more complex operations.

## Getting Started & Usage üöÄ

To begin using this utility, simply clone the repository from GitHub. The process is quick and simple.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Behdad-kanaani/Text2Number-Utility.git
cd Text2Number-Utility
python solution.py
```

### Practical Example

By inputting a text string containing numerical words, the utility provides a single, clean numerical output ready for subsequent processing.

```python
from text2number import solution

text = "two 3s, then three 4s, and finally five 2s"
result = solution(text)
print(f"The final output is: {result}") # The final output is: 24
```

## Project Vision & Roadmap üìà

This utility was built with a clear vision: to serve as a foundational element within **large-scale Machine Learning and NLP data pipelines**. In projects where input data is primarily textual, the Text2Number-Utility acts as a crucial first layer of preprocessing, converting raw data into the numerical format required for model training and analysis.

### Future Development Plans:

  * **Expanded Vocabulary:** Adding support for more number words like "eleven," "twelve," etc.
  * **Handling Compound Numbers:** The ability to process multi-word numbers, such as "twenty-three."
  * **Pipeline Integration:** Optimizing the code for seamless integration into AI data pipelines.
